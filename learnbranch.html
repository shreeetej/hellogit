        Suppose you are working on app and made new and new features but later want to fix bug to older version
        you can't go back and write new features again!
        
        You want to work on all of those things simultaneously and be able to easily switch between them.
        
        Branching is way of git's working on different parts of same depository at same time.
        
        In branches you can keep working and then introduce a new branch if you want to add new feature. Then to fix bug you can
        go back to original branch and make changes to it.
        
        So there are now two different branches, each of them have different code on it, one of which I've been fixing bug and
        one containing the new feature.
        
        Each of the branch is going to have a name, original branch (bug fixing) is master branch or default branch on
        which the stable version of your code is going to be there. And other branch is called feature branch where new features
        are being worked on.

        At any given time your focus is only on one of these two branches. And where your focus branch is, what current state of
        your repository is, is designated by HEAD. So if HEAD is pointing to master then it means your repository is right now
        working on bug fixing branch.

        So HEAD indicates what branch you are working on right now. Like in FIFA, the player you are playing with is represented
        by an arrow on his head.

        You can change the HEAD. You can switch the branch you want to look at. You can work on different branches by switching
        the head.

        And when you are done working, with the bug and the feature too, you can merge those change back together so that everything
        comes back to master branch that now has all the latest code.

        Git branch allows us to work on multiple things simultaneously and then without disrupting the master version of code.

        Let's look at example now ------->
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1> <!--added one exclamation point "!"-->
        
        <!--Now I want to move inline style to head CSS style. I can make it now, but I want to make other changes to original
            code too. Like adding h2 tag on main branch as a new feature. So I have to make changes on new branch to fix styling. -->
        
        <!-- Command "git branch" will tell me what branch I am currently on and what other branches exist in my repository.
            * main ---- is the output on CLI. * means this is the branch I am working on right now.-->

        <!-- So to checkout new branch I can write command "git checkout -b <name_of_branch>" -b is for branch name without ""
            Git gives me a message that I switched to a new branch called h2tag (branch I named) -->

        <!-- If I type git branch again it will show me 2 branches , main and h2tag (with *) -->

        <!-- After making changes, commit those changes using git commit -am "added style to head removed from inline" -->

        <!-- But I have only made changes to h2tag branch. We can switch our branch. Using git checkout -->

        <!-- git checkout -b <name> creates new branch. To switch to other existing branch use code, git checkout <branch name>
            in our case git checkout main -->
