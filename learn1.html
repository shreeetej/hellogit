    Hello world
    <!-- To tell git to keep track of this file, i.e, I'd like to save this -->
    <!-- In git world we these save points as 'commit' -->

    <!-- When we make commit then git will save the current state of all the files, folder and other assets and take a snapshot
    of their current position, such that later we might be able to refer back to them -->
    <!-- To create save point we need to follow steps
    1. addition command - git add <filename> - to tell git that I'd like to keep track of these files, this is the file
        that will be saved next time we make commit.
        
        The reason for 2 steps is because you maybe working on 10 different files and you want to save only 3 in repository
        you can't just save every unnecessary files in repository, that's why add command specifies which to keep track of.

    2. commit command - git commit - saves snapshot of current state of repository, keeping track of any changes made to files
        that I've added using git add.
        Command - git commit -m "message" - where -m is a flag (flags indicate the behaviour of program) and "message"
        contains your description of what changes you've made in the code. You can also refer back to these changes. -->
    
    <!-- In Command line git will say "1 file changed, 29 insertions(+)" i.e 1 file has changes and 29 lines of code are inserted
        the (+) indicates addition of 29 lines. -->

    <!-- When you see online, what changes are made to github you won't see a thing. Because you cloned git repository and
        made changes to local version of repository, it wasn't affecting anything on GitHub, the change was happening on my PC -->

    <!-- To push changes to github you'll need addtitional commands. -->
    <!-- Use command - git status ; to get report on what's happening inside of a repository -->
    <!-- On running git status it'll give a message like:
        "On branch
         Your branch master is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
            (use "git push" to publish your local commits)" -->
    <!-- The command "git pushd" take changes and push them to server -->
