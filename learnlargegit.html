<!-- These are other features of github helpful for working on larger projects. -->

<!-- In this example we will look at bootstrap repository on github. Which is open-source, meaning many people are
contributing to this project. -->

<!-- If you want to contribute to a repository, or want other people to work on your repository, you can fork that repository.
    Means making your own copy of the original repository. -->

<!-- One final thing on Github features is the additional feature called, Github pages.
    Github pages is additional feature that github provides, to be able to quickly take a website with HTML, CSS and little JS
    and deploy it to internet, for FREE. -->

<!-- To do it, create new repository on GitHub, as <"yourusername".github.io>
    Though you can have other names, you'll just have to manually turn on GitHub pages. -->

<!-- Then hit create repository button. If you create repository using your name, it will automatically be supporting
    GitHub Pages. -->
