<!-- When multiple coders make commit and make changes to same part of code. It is called merge conflict -->
<!-- We run into situation where Git doesn't know what to do, because of 2 sets of changes -->
<!-- We need to figure out what to do when we run into this sort of conflict -->
<!-- During conflict git will show message like:
    "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in abc.py, fix the conflicts and then commit the result. " -->

<!-- In a conflict the file will show something like this:
    a=22
    <<<<<< HEAD (indicating my code change below)
    b=31
    ======= (divider above is my code change below is other's code changes)
    b=0
    >>>>>>> 4567489415364987 (hashcode of conflict > indicating other's code changes above)
    c=17
    d=11 -->

    
    <!-- Remove this conflict markers in the file and then decide which code to keep in the file
    a=22
    
    b=31
    
    
    
    c=17
    d=11 -->
